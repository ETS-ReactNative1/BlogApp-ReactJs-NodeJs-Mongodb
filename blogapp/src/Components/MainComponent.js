                                <p>React is a JavaScript-based UI development library. Facebook and an open-source developer community run it. Although React is a library rather than a <code>language</code>, it is widely used in web development  React offers various extensions for entire application architectural support, such as Flux and React Native, beyond mere UI.</p>
                                <p>The library first appeared in May 2013 and is now one of the most commonly used frontend libraries for web development.</p>
